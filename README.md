## Project Description

**xTour** mobile application help users to share their experience and recommendation for other people about a place that they visited. The places can be historical, towns and cites and Natural areas. The users can share their experience by uploading photos, videos and texts that describes how their involvement in their trip went. Users can be entertained and get information by observing other people posts and make a wishlist for future plans. The postes can get a like and a comment from other users. And also the users can get followers based on the content they are displaying on this platform.

**xTour** also provides an oppotunity for Users to be a *"Journalists"* after validating them by the Admin and they can start posting their journal via website links. The journals created will be available to other users after get approved by the Admin.

The Admin makes sure of the smooth running of the application for the users by making it a safe space for sharing their experiences and authorizing the users for the maintainance of users privacy and security. This is achieved by pending posts and journals made by the user for approval before making it available for other users.
